                <p>Hi there! I am glad you stopped by.
                    My name is Mason Namminga and I am a high school Junior attending Lynden High
                    School. I am currently the FBLA Vice President, cross country runner, and
                    technology enthusiast. I was born in Colorado and moved to Lynden, WA as a child. While growing
                    up I discovered my passion to build, discover, and learn. I have always enjoyed the endeavor of
                    learning new skills and am always eager to try something new. If I was to pinpoint the exact
                    date that I began my journey of creation it would be when I got my first robotics kit. This
                    sparked a journey of making and discovering. Check out all the best projects that I have
                    produced over the years on the projects page, linked on the navigation bar. With this desire to
                    learn began my journey of learning to code. I began my coding venture when creating excel
                    spreadsheets, and PowerPoints that incorporated Microsoft VBA to add custom elements. After
                    learning the basics of this language, I set out to create a custom hand-coded website to display
                    all of the things that I had built over the summer. This endeavor helped create the passion for
                    web development that I have pursued throughout my high school career. See more about my academic
                    ventures on the Academics page. If you have any questions or comments that you would like to
                    send my way, please navigate to the contact page for a quick and easy way to get in touch.
