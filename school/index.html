                School has always been something that I have enjoyed throughout my life. I have enjoyed the
                social connections, extracurricular activities, and pushing myself in academically rigorous
                classes. Through all of these experiences, I have gained a much greater insight into what it
                means to be a motivated student. The classes and activities that I have filled my schedule have
                taught me many skills such as time management and knowing when to take a break. Middle school
                was a great time of self-discovery to determine where I wanted to shift my focus when it
                came to what classes I wanted to spend my time in high school on. During my three
                years of middle school, I came to realize that I had a passion for science and art/design.
                Discovering these interests early on greatly impacted my class choices when it came to creating
                a high school transcript that I was proud of. Shifting the focus to my high school career I
                began freshman year on Zoom completing all work virtually and eventually toward the end of the
                year transitioned into a hybrid learning model. During this time, I was able to take advantage
                of the benefits of online learning such as a flexible schedule, learning from any location, and
                my favorite, very casual attire. However, the school has since made another transition back to
                in-person learning. Returning to my high school campus opened a door of opportunities,
                especially when it came to classes such as floral design, horticultural science, 3D engineering,
                and design, classes that had been detrimentally affected by the shift to online learning.
                Starting Sophomore year campus has fully reopened and classes have resumed as normal.
