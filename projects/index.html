            <p>A big part of who I am is building things. Ever since I was young I have always had a knack for
                taking things apart and putting them back together. This knack for understanding how things work
                has helped pave the way for my passion to create. Throughout the years I have gradually improved
                moving from simple electronics in my childhood to more advanced software-driven microcomputers
                such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi in my teen years. Some of the projects that I enjoy working on
                the most involve coding via Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Microsoft VBA, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript.
                I also enjoy woodworking, 3D printing, and graphic design.

                        The Bookbot was a project that I took on simply because I wanted to use up some scrap wood,
                        however it has evolved into so much more. Starting in 2018 I constructed a small box with hand
                        painted lettering that said ‚ÄúThe Book Shack.‚Äù After 2 more iterations and a whole lot more
                        waterproofing we now have the Bookbot, take a book and leave a book library for my neighborhood.
                        The Bookbot features a screen as a head that I update with seasonal displays, color changing
                        lights on the body and arms, as well as speakers that play calming music for those that stop to
                        take a look!

                        allowing anyone in the world to change the color at any time of the day. It is made of a 2x3 foot
                        light panel hanging on a wall in my home. The light diffuser was salvaged from an old TV and the
                        frame is made from reclaimed wood.

                    <p style="color: black; font-family:Helvetica Neue">
                        The Smart Snack Machine had always been an idea that was in the back of my head, but it wasn't
                        until I was introduced to the Hack Club Winter Hardware Wonderland program that I realized that
                        I could make this dream a reality. After creating a proposal and budget I presented my idea to
                        the Hack Club team and received the portion of the funds needed to create the project. After
                        about a year of working, a lot of failure and experimentation, I am very proud to share the
                        Smart Snack Machine. It features a variety of ways to "pay" for a snack, including a mobile pay
                        option where users make an account with the app on their phones, a coin acceptor, and my
                        favorite feature, games! Users can play games on the integrated touch screen to earn a snack.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>How I Made It</h5>
                    <p style="color: black; font-family:Helvetica Neue">
                        The machine is made of wood, and plexiglass, as well as barn wire that was wrapped up to make
                        the coils. The coils are run by an array of 14 servo motors that are controlled by 2 NodeMCU
                        boards. These boards are connected to WiFi to receive signals from the Raspberry Pi computer
                        that is attached to the touch screen. An interesting aspect of controlling the servos over WiFi
                        is that in the future I can create an app that allows users to order from their phone, from
                        anywhere in the world. (If they want to "gift" a snack to someone...) The coin acceptor is run
                        by an Arduino Leonardo that is directly connected to the Raspberry Pi. Finally a QR code
                        scanning camera was added to be able to scan the user's "Mobile Wallet Key" if they choose to
                        pay with credits that are in the Snack Machine App.
                    </p>
